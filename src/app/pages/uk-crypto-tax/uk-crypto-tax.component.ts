    {
      question: 'Do I pay tax when I sell crypto in the UK?',

      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'Is swapping crypto-to-crypto taxable in the UK?',

      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I report crypto to HMRC?',
      answer: 'You report via Self Assessment or HMRC\'s CGT real-time reporting tool. You\'ll need GBP values for all disposals.',
