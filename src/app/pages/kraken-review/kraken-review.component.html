        <section>
          <p>For UK traders seeking a balance between security, regulatory clarity, and advanced trading features, Kraken presents a compelling option. The platform's <strong>FCA authorisation</strong> and defence-in-depth security approach make it particularly attractive to security-conscious investors.</p>

          <p>The competitive maker/taker pricing structure benefits active traders, while practical GBP rails ensure smooth deposits and withdrawals. However, retail UK users should complete <strong>Intermediate verification</strong> before moving significant amounts or attempting to access advanced products.</p>

        <!-- Derivatives Special Note -->
        <section>
          <h3>Important Note on Derivatives</h3>

          <p>Derivatives trading on Kraken, including perpetuals and futures, is available but <strong>gated for professional clients</strong> in the UK. Retail clients should not expect access unless they meet strict professional client criteria. This restriction is in place to comply with UK financial regulations designed to protect retail investors from high-risk products.</p>

          <p>For developers, quants, and serious traders, Kraken's <strong>API and demo environment</strong> provide valuable tools to backtest strategies before deploying capital. The demo environment is particularly useful for understanding how derivatives work without financial risk.</p>

        <!-- Pros & Cons -->
        <section>
          <h2>Pros & Cons</h2>

          <p>Every exchange has strengths and weaknesses, and Kraken is no exception. Understanding these trade-offs helps you make an informed decision about whether Kraken aligns with your trading needs and priorities. The platform excels in security and regulatory compliance but may not be the simplest option for complete beginners.</p>

          <p>The fee structure, while competitive for active traders, can be less attractive for casual investors making small, infrequent trades. Additionally, the <strong>verification process</strong>, while thorough for security reasons, can take several days to complete during busy periods.</p>

        <!-- Why Choose Kraken - Storytelling -->
        <section>
          <h2>Why Choose Kraken?</h2>

          <p>Choosing the right exchange often comes down to real-world scenarios. Consider this: it's Friday evening, and you want to move <strong>£5,000</strong> to catch a market opportunity on Monday. With Kraken, you have multiple options that balance speed, cost, and security. This flexibility becomes crucial when markets move quickly.</p>

          <p>Security isn't just a marketing point for Kraken—it's operational reality. The platform runs public bug bounties, enforces robust two-factor authentication, and keeps the majority of customer funds in <strong>cold storage</strong>. For UK users asking "is Kraken safe?", these practices significantly reduce platform-level risks.</p>

        <!-- Deposits & Withdrawals -->
        <section>
          <h2>Deposits & Withdrawals — Faster Payments vs CHAPS</h2>

          <p>Understanding Kraken's banking options is essential for UK users. The platform offers two primary methods for GBP transactions: <strong>Faster Payments</strong> for quick, everyday transfers, and <strong>CHAPS</strong> for larger amounts requiring same-day settlement. Each method has different characteristics in terms of speed, limits, and potential fees.</p>

          <p>The choice between these methods depends on your transfer size and timing requirements. Faster Payments typically process near-instantly with no Kraken fees, making them ideal for regular top-ups. CHAPS, while potentially involving intermediary bank fees, provides same-day crediting for time-sensitive large transfers.</p>

        <!-- Fee Structure with Concrete Examples -->
        <section>
          <h2>Fee Structure — Concrete Example</h2>

          <p>Rather than vague comparisons, here are the actual numbers from Kraken's official fee schedule. Understanding these concrete costs helps you evaluate whether Kraken's pricing works for your trading volume and style.</p>

          <p>Kraken uses maker/taker tiers based on 30-day USD volume. The more you trade, the lower your fees become. Here's how the official tiers look:</p>

          <app-material-comparison-table
            title="Kraken Maker/Taker Snapshot (Spot Crypto)"
            [columns]="feeScheduleColumns"
            [rows]="feeScheduleRows">
          </app-material-comparison-table>

          <h3>Real-world Examples (GBP) — Exact Math</h3>

          <div class="fee-example">
            <h4>Scenario A — Casual Investor</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Monthly trading volume: <strong>£200</strong> (one buy order)</li>
              <li>Typical order type for small instant buy = <strong>taker</strong> (market/instant buy)</li>
              <li>Fee assumption: tier $0+ (taker <strong>0.40%</strong>) — conservative, official base rate</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Calculation:</strong> £200 × 0.40% = <strong>£0.80</strong> fee. Net crypto bought ≈ £199.20 (ignoring spread).</p>
            <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> For most casual users the absolute fees are tiny (sub-£1 on a £200 buy). The fee amount is negligible compared with market moves; choose Kraken for security and rails rather than micro-fee savings.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="fee-example">
            <h4>Scenario B — Active Trader / Higher Volume</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Monthly trading volume: <strong>£100,000</strong> (total executed volume)</li>
              <li>Convert to USD ≈ <strong>$125,000</strong> (approx. FX ×1.25) — note Kraken tiers are in USD</li>
              <li>That volume sits near the <strong>$100k+</strong> tier, so use maker <strong>0.12%</strong> / taker <strong>0.22%</strong> as working rates</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Calculation</strong> (assume all taker for conservative estimate): £100,000 × 0.22% = <strong>£220</strong> total fees for the month.</p>
            <p>If a portion is maker (limit orders), cost lowers: e.g., 50/50 split maker/taker → (£50,000 × 0.12%) + (£50,000 × 0.22%) = £60 + £110 = <strong>£170</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Active traders quickly benefit from tiered discounts — going from ~0.40% to ~0.22% (or lower) reduces monthly fees materially. For high volumes the difference is dozens to hundreds of pounds per month.</p>

          <h2>Final Verdict — Who Should Use Kraken in the UK?</h2>

          <p>Kraken excels for UK users who prioritize security, regulatory clarity, and competitive trading economics.
