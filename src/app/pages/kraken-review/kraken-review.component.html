            Extensive Trading Options (Kraken — UK)
          </h2>
          <p>
            Kraken offers a broad set of market products for UK users: core <strong>spot</strong> markets, <strong>margin</strong>-enabled spot positions for eligible accounts, and <strong>derivatives</strong> via Kraken Perps / Kraken Futures. Availability and per-product limits depend on your verification level and regional eligibility — always confirm live details on Kraken’s product pages.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Spot trading
          </h3>

          <p>
            Kraken’s spot markets let you buy, sell and custody cryptocurrencies directly via orderbooks. The exchange lists hundreds of supported coins and tokens across spot and Pro markets; asset availability can vary by country and by network.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Margin (spot margin)
          </h3>

          <p>
            Margin trading on Kraken allows eligible users to borrow funds to increase position size on spot pairs. Leverage levels vary by pair, but Kraken’s margin product documentation shows commonly available leverage up to around 5–10× depending on the market and pair — exact max leverage is shown per pair in Kraken’s margin tables. UK clients must meet specific eligibility rules (for example declaring high net worth borrower status) to use margin with fiat and fiat-backed stablecoins. Always verify eligibility and per-pair limits in Kraken Pro.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Perpetuals & Futures (Derivatives)
          </h3>

          <p>
            Kraken provides perpetual futures (“Perps”) and broader futures products via Kraken Perps / Kraken Futures. Perps on Kraken advertise up to <strong> 10× buying power </strong>for retail/Perps products, designed to let traders take directional positions without an expiry; Kraken’s derivatives platform documentation also notes that certain professional/institutional contracts can offer higher leverage (support docs reference up to 50× for specific derivative offerings). Access to derivatives is eligibility-gated and may be restricted by jurisdiction. Derivatives carry high risk — margin, funding rates and liquidation mechanics apply.

            [rows]="tradingInstrumentsRows">
          </app-material-comparison-table>

          <h3>Automation, APIs & demo trading</h3>

          <p>
            Kraken provides REST and WebSocket APIs for programmatic trading and data access; the docs cover order placement, account and market data endpoints. Kraken also runs a derivatives demo/paper-trading environment so traders can test strategies without risking real funds — use the demo to validate bots and logic before going live. API and demo access details are in Kraken's developer and support documentation.

          <h3>Practical notes for UK users</h3>

          <app-bullet-list [items]="practicalNotesItems"></app-bullet-list>

          <p>
            <strong>Bottom line.</strong> Kraken covers spot, margin (to eligible UK users), perpetuals and futures (via Kraken Perps / Futures), plus APIs and a demo environment for testing strategies. These instruments offer wide flexibility but carry materially different risk profiles and access rules — always confirm your account eligibility, per-product leverage and live limits on Kraken's official pages before trading.

          <h2>How Does Kraken Work?</h2>

          <p>
            Kraken is more than just a cryptocurrency exchange — it's a platform designed to help UK traders navigate the crypto market safely and efficiently. From creating your account to executing your first trade, here's how Kraken works for UK users.
          </p>

          <h3>How to Sign Up on Kraken UK</h3>

          <p>
            Getting started on Kraken is surprisingly straightforward, even if you're new to crypto. UK users begin by visiting the <strong>Kraken registration page</strong>, where you'll enter a valid email, choose a username, and create a strong password. After agreeing to the terms of service and privacy policy, a confirmation link will be sent to your inbox.
          </p>

          <p>
            Clicking this link gives you access to a basic Kraken account, which lets you explore the platform. However, to <strong>trade crypto in the UK</strong> or deposit GBP, you'll need to verify your identity — a necessary step to comply with financial regulations and keep your account secure.
          </p>

          <p>
            At this stage, it's worth noting: <strong>Kraken's user interface is designed to guide you smoothly through registration</strong>, making it accessible for both beginners and more experienced traders.
          </p>

          <h3>How to Verify Your Identity on Kraken UK</h3>

          <p>
            Verification is a cornerstone of Kraken's commitment to security and regulatory compliance. Following strict <strong>AML/KYC requirements</strong>, Kraken offers tiered verification levels that affect <strong>deposit limits, withdrawal limits, and trading access</strong>:
          </p>

          <app-bullet-list [items]="verificationLevels"></app-bullet-list>

          <p>
            Verification is done through Kraken's secure upload portal, and processing usually takes a few hours to a few days. For UK traders, completing this step efficiently ensures access to all trading features and GBP banking options without delays.
          </p>

          <h3>How to Trade on Kraken UK</h3>

          <p>
            Once verified, trading on Kraken opens up a world of opportunities. The platform supports <strong>Spot, Margin, and Futures (Perps) trading</strong>, giving UK users flexibility depending on their experience and strategy.
          </p>

          <app-bullet-list [items]="tradingSteps"></app-bullet-list>

          <p>
            Kraken also provides <strong>API access</strong> and a demo environment, allowing UK traders to test strategies without risking real funds. Always check <strong>margin requirements, leverage limits, and live fees</strong> before engaging in derivatives trading — these can significantly affect outcomes.
