          <p class="section-text">
            Each exchange undergoes a <strong>30-day</strong> evaluation in which our experts perform real trades,
            test funding and withdrawals, contact customer support, review security controls, and assess overall usability.
            We <strong>refresh reviews quarterly</strong> to reflect product changes and performance.
