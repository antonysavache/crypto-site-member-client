    // Security & Storage
    {
      question: 'Is it safe to keep crypto on Kraken in the UK?',
      answer: 'Kraken is FCA-registered and widely considered one of the most secure exchanges. It uses cold storage, 2FA, and a public bug bounty program. For long-term holdings, we still recommend moving funds to a hardware wallet to eliminate counterparty risk.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the safest way to store Ethereum long-term?',
      answer: 'The safest method is self-custody using a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor. Store your seed phrase offline (never in cloud storage) and test small transactions first. This keeps your ETH secure even if an exchange is hacked.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I enable 2FA on a crypto exchange account?',
      answer: 'Log into your exchange, go to Security settings, and enable "Two-Factor Authentication." Use an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy) rather than SMS. Scan the QR code, save backup codes, and test login before funding your account.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'Are SMS codes secure for crypto login?',
      answer: 'No. SMS can be intercepted via SIM-swap attacks. Always use a TOTP-based authenticator app or hardware security key (YubiKey) for maximum account protection.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'What is a withdrawal whitelist and why should I use it?',
      answer: 'A withdrawal whitelist is a list of approved wallet addresses. Funds can only be sent to these addresses. Enabling it prevents attackers from sending funds to their own wallet even if they compromise your account.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    // Scams & Fraud Prevention
    {
      question: 'How do I avoid crypto phishing scams in the UK?',
      answer: 'Bookmark official exchange URLs, never click links from emails or DMs, and double-check domain spelling. Use browser extensions like MetaMask only on trusted websites. If in doubt, verify URLs manually or type them in directly.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I know if a DeFi project is a rug pull?',
      answer: 'Look for red flags: anonymous team, no audits, liquidity not locked, promises of "guaranteed" returns. Check the project\'s GitHub and community — lack of transparency is a warning sign.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the most common crypto scam in 2025?',
      answer: 'Phishing remains the number one attack vector — fake airdrops, malicious ads, and impersonation websites trick users into entering seed phrases.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I report a crypto scam in the UK?',
      answer: 'Report scams to Action Fraud (the UK\'s national fraud reporting centre) and inform your exchange immediately if your funds are at risk.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    // Technical & Exchange Risks
    {
      question: 'Can exchanges freeze my crypto withdrawals?',
      answer: 'Yes. Exchanges may temporarily freeze withdrawals for compliance reviews, system upgrades, or security incidents. This is why it\'s smart to keep trading funds on exchange but store long-term holdings in self-custody.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if my exchange gets hacked — do I lose my crypto?',
      answer: 'If funds are stolen and the exchange does not reimburse users, you may lose your crypto. Some platforms have insurance funds, but payouts aren\'t guaranteed. Minimise exposure by using FCA-registered exchanges and withdrawing funds after large purchases.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I secure my MetaMask wallet from hacks?',
      answer: 'Download MetaMask only from the official website or Chrome Web Store, use a hardware wallet for signing transactions, regularly revoke token approvals, and never share your seed phrase.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'What is slashing risk in Ethereum staking?',
      answer: 'Slashing happens when a validator misbehaves (double-signing, downtime). On Kraken, the platform handles validator operations and covers infrastructure risks, but rewards may still be reduced.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'Can someone steal my crypto if they know my wallet address?',
      answer: 'No — a wallet address is public information, like a bank account number. Funds can only be moved with your private key or seed phrase. Keep those private and never share them.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    // Practical Questions
    {
      question: 'What is the risk of leaving crypto on an exchange overnight?',
      answer: 'Short-term risk is low on reputable exchanges, but it is never zero. System outages, hacks, or sudden freezes can occur. If you\'re not trading actively, consider moving funds to a hardware wallet.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need a hardware wallet if I only hold £500 worth of crypto?',
      answer: 'A hardware wallet is optional for small amounts but strongly recommended once your portfolio exceeds £500–£1,000. Even a single hack or phishing incident could wipe out your funds, so the cost of protection is usually worth it.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the safest way to send crypto for the first time?',
      answer: 'Send a small test amount first, verify on Etherscan that it arrived, then send the remainder. Always double-check the destination address manually or with a QR code.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'Are public Wi-Fi networks safe for trading crypto?',
      answer: 'No. Public Wi-Fi can be intercepted. Use a VPN or mobile data when logging into exchanges or wallets.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if I lose my seed phrase?',
      answer: 'If you lose your seed phrase and your device fails, you lose access to your funds permanently. Store multiple backups securely in different locations.',
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I check if my exchange is FCA-registered in the UK?',
      answer: 'Visit the FCA\'s Financial Services Register and search for the exchange\'s name. Only use platforms listed as cryptoasset businesses.',
      isOpen: false
    }
