  // FAQ данные из статьи
  protected readonly faqItems: FaqItem[] = [
    {
      question: 'What is bitcoin and how does it work?',
      answer: 'Bitcoin is digital money that works through a decentralised network of computers. Transactions are grouped into blocks and added to a permanent ledger (blockchain) through a process called mining, where computers compete to validate transactions and secure the network.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is bitcoin legal in the uk?',
      answer: 'Yes, Bitcoin is legal in the UK. It\'s regulated as a cryptoasset by the FCA, and you can buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin legally, though specific tax obligations apply to gains and income.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How secure is bitcoin for investors in the UK?',
      answer: 'Bitcoin\'s blockchain is extremely secure, with no successful attacks on the main network. However, investor security depends on proper storage practices. Use reputable exchanges and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the bitcoin price in gbp today?',
      answer: 'Bitcoin price fluctuates constantly. Check real-time BTC to GBP rates on exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase, or financial websites. Prices can vary slightly between platforms due to trading volumes and liquidity.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How many bitcoins are left to mine?',
      answer: 'Approximately 1.3 million bitcoins remain to be mined from the total 21 million supply. At current mining rates, the final bitcoin will be mined around 2140.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What does bitcoin do better than fiat currency?',
      answer: 'Bitcoin offers programmable scarcity, borderless transactions, 24/7 availability, transparency, and immunity from central bank monetary policy changes, unlike fiat currencies that can be printed indefinitely.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Why is bitcoin called digital gold?',
      answer: 'Bitcoin shares gold\'s properties as a store of value: limited supply, durability, divisibility, and independence from government control. However, Bitcoin is more portable and verifiable than physical gold.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does bitcoin mining affect the environment?',
      answer: 'Bitcoin mining consumes significant energy, but the industry is increasingly using renewable sources. Many mining operations now use excess renewable energy that would otherwise be wasted.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the risks of holding bitcoin in the uk?',
      answer: 'Key risks include price volatility, regulatory changes, technological risks, custody challenges, and tax complexity. The FCA warns that you could lose all your money.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How to store bitcoin safely in the uk?',
      answer: 'Use hardware wallets for large amounts, reputable software wallets for smaller amounts, and enable all security features. Keep backup seed phrases secure and consider using multi-signature setups for substantial holdings.'
