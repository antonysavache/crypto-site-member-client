        <h2>How to Buy BTC in the UK</h2>
        <p>
          Purchasing Bitcoin in the UK has become increasingly straightforward. Here's a quick example using Kraken, one of the leading exchanges:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Create Account:</strong> Register on Kraken.com with your email and verify your identity with UK documentation</li>
        </ol>

  // What is Bitcoin?

      <section>
        <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
        <p>
          Bitcoin is the world's first <strong>decentralised digital currency</strong>, created in 2009 by the pseudonymous <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>. Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, Bitcoin operates on a <strong>peer-to-peer network</strong> where transactions are verified by computers worldwide and recorded on an immutable public ledger called the <strong>blockchain</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its core, Bitcoin solves the <strong>"double-spending problem"</strong> that plagued previous digital cash attempts, ensuring that each bitcoin can only be spent once without requiring a trusted intermediary.
        </p>
      </section>

  // Brief Origin & History
  {
    html: `
      <section>
        <h2>Brief Origin & History and Why Bitcoin Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Bitcoin emerged from the <strong>2008 financial crisis</strong> as a response to traditional banking failures. Nakamoto's whitepaper introduced a revolutionary concept: money that exists purely in digital form, cannot be counterfeited, and operates <strong>independently of government control</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>Key milestones include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2009:</strong> First Bitcoin transaction</li>
          <li><strong>2010:</strong> First real-world purchase (10,000 BTC for two pizzas)</li>
          <li><strong>2017:</strong> Mainstream attention as Bitcoin price reached nearly $20,000</li>
          <li><strong>2021:</strong> Corporate adoption by companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy</li>
          <li><strong>2024-2025:</strong> Bitcoin ETF approvals and increasing institutional integration</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Bitcoin matters because it represents the first successful attempt at creating <strong>truly scarce digital money</strong>, challenging traditional monetary systems and offering an alternative <strong>store of value</strong> in an era of currency debasement.

  // Technical Overview

      <section>
        <h2>How Bitcoin Works — A Simple Technical Overview</h2>

        <div class="key-value-table">
          <h3>Bitcoin Key Specifications</h3>
          <table>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td><strong>Launch Date</strong></td><td>January 3, 2009</td></tr>
              <tr><td><strong>Creator</strong></td><td>Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym)</td></tr>
              <tr><td><strong>Max Supply</strong></td><td>21 million BTC</td></tr>
              <tr><td><strong>Consensus Algorithm</strong></td><td>Proof of Work (PoW)</td></tr>
              <tr><td><strong>Block Time</strong></td><td>~10 minutes</td></tr>
              <tr><td><strong>Remaining to Mine</strong></td><td>~1.3 million BTC</td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <h3>Proof-of-Work (PoW)</h3>
        <p>
          Bitcoin uses a <strong>Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism</strong> where "miners" compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The first to solve the puzzle validates the next block of transactions and receives newly minted bitcoin as a reward. This process, known as <strong>Bitcoin mining</strong>, secures the network and prevents fraud.
        </p>

        <h3>Supply Mechanics & Halvings</h3>
        <p>
          Bitcoin's monetary policy is programmed and predictable. Only <strong>21 million Bitcoin</strong> will ever exist, making it inherently <strong>deflationary</strong>. Approximately every four years, the reward for mining new blocks is <strong>halved</strong>, reducing the rate at which new bitcoin enters circulation. The next halving is expected around <strong>2028</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features & Benefits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Decentralisation:</strong> No single point of failure or control</li>
          <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> All transactions are publicly viewable on the blockchain</li>
          <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Once confirmed, transactions cannot be reversed</li>
          <li><strong>Global accessibility:</strong> 24/7 operation without geographical restrictions</li>
          <li><strong>Programmable scarcity:</strong> Fixed supply creates digital scarcity</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Risks & Criticisms, Security & Custody Options</h2>

        <h3>Primary Risks</h3>
        <p>Bitcoin faces several challenges that potential investors should understand:</p>

        <div class="risk-table">

              <tr>
                <td><strong>Volatility</strong></td>
                <td>Bitcoin price movements can be extreme, with daily fluctuations of 10%+ not uncommon. The Bitcoin price in GBP has ranged from under £3,000 to over £50,000 in recent years.</td>

              <tr>
                <td><strong>Regulatory uncertainty</strong></td>

              <tr>
                <td><strong>Environmental impact</strong></td>
                <td>Bitcoin mining consumes significant energy, though renewable adoption is increasing.</td>

            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <h3>Security & Custody Options</h3>
        <p>Securing Bitcoin requires careful consideration:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hardware wallets</strong> (Ledger, Trezor): Best for long-term storage</li>
          <li><strong>Software wallets:</strong> Convenient for regular transactions</li>
          <li><strong>Exchange custody:</strong> Easiest but carries counterparty risk</li>
          <li><strong>Institutional custody:</strong> Growing options for larger holdings</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Remember: "Not your keys, not your bitcoin." Proper custody is crucial for Bitcoin security.</em></p>
