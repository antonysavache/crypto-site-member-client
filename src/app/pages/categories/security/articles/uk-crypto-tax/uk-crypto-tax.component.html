            Crypto taxes don't have to be intimidating. In the UK, cryptocurrency is treated as <strong>property</strong>, meaning most disposals (selling, swapping, or spending) are subject to <strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</strong> — not income tax. This guide breaks down everything you need to know about reporting crypto gains, staking rewards, and losses in plain English.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is <strong>not financial or tax advice</strong>, but a practical starting point for UK investors who want to stay compliant and avoid HMRC surprises.

          <h2>How Crypto is Taxed in the UK</h2>
          <h3>Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</h3>
          <p>
            You pay CGT when you sell crypto for GBP, swap one coin for another (e.g. ETH → BTC), or use crypto to pay for goods and services. In 2025, the annual CGT allowance is <strong>£3,000</strong> — gains below this amount are tax-free. Rates are <strong>10% or 20%</strong> depending on your total income.
          </p>

          <h3>Income Tax</h3>
          <p>
            Crypto you receive as <strong>staking rewards, mining payouts, or airdrops</strong> may be treated as income at the market value in GBP at the time of receipt. Subsequent sales are then subject to CGT on any additional gains.
          </p>

          <h3>HMRC Record-Keeping Rules</h3>
          <p>
            You must track the GBP value of every crypto transaction at the time it happens. HMRC uses this data to calculate gains/losses and expects accurate records for up to <strong>5 years</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2>Capital Gains Tax Explained</h2>

          <p>
            Understanding Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is crucial for any UK crypto investor. HMRC treats most crypto disposals as taxable events — meaning you owe tax not just when you "cash out," but also when you swap coins or spend crypto.
          </p>

          <h3>What Triggers CGT Events?</h3>
          <p>
            CGT applies in several common scenarios:
          </p>

          <h3>How to Calculate Gains</h3>
          <p>
            HMRC uses this formula:
          </p>

          <div class="formula-card">
            <div class="formula-main">
              <strong>Gain = Proceeds – (Cost Basis + Transaction Fees)</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="formula-explanation">
              <p>Where:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Proceeds</strong> = GBP value received when selling or swapping</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Basis</strong> = your average purchase price (per HMRC's Section 104 pooling rules)</li>
                <li><strong>Fees</strong> = exchange fees or gas costs you can add to cost basis</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <img src="/images/uk-crypto-tax/section-104-pooling.png" alt="FormulaCard component — big bold equation, small tooltip explaining Section 104 Pooling" class="tax-guide-image" />

          <p>
            Pooling means you calculate an average cost basis for all identical assets you hold — similar to share dealing rules.
          </p>

          <h3>Example Calculation</h3>

          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You bought 1 ETH in January for £1,200 and sold it in March for £1,800.</p>

          <p>
            If your annual gains exceed the <strong>£3,000 CGT allowance (2025)</strong>, here's what you'd pay:

        <!-- Income Tax on Staking, Mining & Airdrops -->
        <section>
          <h2>Income Tax on Staking, Mining & Airdrops</h2>

          <p>
            Not all crypto is taxed under Capital Gains rules — in some cases, HMRC treats it as <strong>income</strong> when you receive it. This is especially relevant for ETH staking rewards, which are becoming a major source of yield for UK investors.
          </p>

          <h3>Staking Rewards</h3>
          <p>
            Any ETH you earn through staking (either directly running a validator or using Kraken's staking product) is taxed as <strong>income at the moment you receive it</strong>. The GBP value on that day is what you must report. When you later sell that ETH, you'll also pay CGT on any price change since you received it.
          </p>

          <img src="/images/uk-crypto-tax/receive-record-sale-cgt.png" alt="small diagram: Receive ETH → Record GBP value → Later sale → CGT on difference" class="tax-guide-image" />

          <h3>Mining Rewards</h3>
          <p>
            If you mine crypto:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hobby miners</strong> are taxed on the GBP value of coins mined as miscellaneous income.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional miners</strong> may have to register as a business and pay Income Tax + National Insurance contributions on profits after expenses.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Airdrops</h3>
          <p>
            HMRC distinguishes between free promotional airdrops and those tied to an action (e.g. tweeting, signing up).
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Genuine gift:</strong> may not be taxable until sold.</li>
            <li><strong>Reward for action:</strong> treated as income at GBP value when received.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Record-Keeping & Tools</h2>

          <p>
            Good record-keeping is the backbone of stress-free crypto taxes in the UK. HMRC requires you to keep <strong>detailed transaction records for at least 5 years</strong> after the end of the tax year. If you can't produce them, you may face penalties or estimated assessments.
          </p>

          <h3>What to Track</h3>
          <p>

          <p>
            Selling crypto at a loss isn't always bad news — you can use those losses to reduce future tax bills.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Claiming Losses:</strong> Report capital losses to HMRC in the same tax year. They can offset gains on other crypto assets or even other investments.</li>
            <li><strong>Carrying Forward:</strong> Unused losses can be carried forward to offset gains in future tax years — just make sure you report them within four years of the loss.</li>

          <p>
            HMRC's guidance on DeFi is <strong>still evolving</strong>, so the safest approach is to keep <strong>detailed records</strong> of every deposit, withdrawal, and reward.
