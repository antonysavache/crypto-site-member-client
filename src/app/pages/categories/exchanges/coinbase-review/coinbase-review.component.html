        <h2>What is Coinbase UK?</h2>
        <p>Coinbase was founded in San Francisco in 2012 and initially worked as a simple Bitcoin broker. Over the years, it transformed into one of the most significant cryptocurrency businesses globally. In 2021, the company was listed on NASDAQ, which brought additional transparency and trust to its operations.</p>

        <img src="/images/coin-base-review-intro.webp" alt="Coinbase Review Introduction" />

        <p>
          In the UK, <b>Coinbase exchange UK</b> serves retail investors, small businesses, and even institutions. The local platform allows users to deposit GBP through Faster Payments, link a bank card, and trade more than 100 digital assets. Coinbase UK has millions of customers, making it one of the most popular ways to access the crypto market in Britain.
        </p>

        <p>
          The company’s mission is to create an open financial system for the world. For British investors, this means having an accessible entry point to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other tokens without relying on smaller or unregulated exchanges.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Coinbase FCA Regulation and Safety
        </h3>

        <p>
          One of the most important questions for new users is: Is Coinbase legal in UK? The answer is yes — but with important nuances. Coinbase operates under an <b>FCA e-money licence</b> in the UK. This licence applies to fiat transactions such as GBP deposits and withdrawals, ensuring that customer funds are handled in compliance with financial standards.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the <b>crypto trading activity itself is not directly regulated by the FCA</b>, since digital assets are considered high-risk investments. Coinbase is registered with the FCA under the Money Laundering Regulations, which means it must follow strict anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) rules.
        </p>

        <p>
          For safety, Coinbase keeps the majority of digital assets in cold storage, applies two-factor authentication, and insures custodial holdings against theft or cybersecurity breaches. British users should also be aware of tax obligations: profits from crypto are subject to <b>Capital Gains Tax</b>, which must be reported to HMRC.
        </p>

        <app-key-value-table [items]="regulationAndSafetyFeatures" [title]="'Regulation & Safety Features'" />

        <p>
          Overall, while crypto itself is not covered by the FCA’s investor protection schemes, Coinbase’s regulatory status provides more confidence than many <b>Coinbase alternatives</b> available in the UK.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Coinbase Products Available in the UK
        </h3>

        <p>
          For British users, <b>Coinbase UK</b> offers a full ecosystem that goes beyond simple trading. Each service is designed to make cryptocurrency more accessible, whether you are a beginner or a professional investor. Below is an overview of the core products available in the UK.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main platform, often called the “simple” <strong>Coinbase exchange UK</strong>, is built for newcomers. It allows users to <b>buy crypto UK</b> such as Bitcoin or Ethereum directly with pounds. The interface is straightforward: select the coin, enter the amount, and confirm the purchase. A clean dashboard shows balances, price charts, and transaction history.
        </p>

        <img src="/images/coinbase-pro.webp" alt="coin-base-pro" />

        <p>
          For more experienced traders, Coinbase Pro offers a professional environment with lower fees, advanced charting tools, and order types (market, limit, stop). It is still linked to your Coinbase account, so you can move funds instantly between the two. Maker and taker fees are applied, which can be significantly cheaper than flat fees on the basic exchange.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Coinbase Wallet
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Coinbase wallet UK</strong> is a self-custody app that lets you store your own private keys and interact with decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. It supports thousands of tokens and NFTs, giving more independence compared to the custodial exchange. For beginners, it is optional, but for advanced users, it offers greater control over assets.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Coinbase Card (Visa debit in UK)
        </h3>

        <p>
          The Coinbase card UK is a Visa debit card that allows users to spend their crypto balance in pounds anywhere Visa is accepted. It can also earn cashback in crypto (up to 4% depending on the token). The card can be managed directly via the Coinbase app, making it a useful everyday tool for those who want to integrate crypto with daily spending.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Coinbase Earn (crypto rewards)
        </h3>

        <p>
          Coinbase Earn provides educational tutorials where users watch short videos about specific cryptocurrencies and receive small amounts of those coins as rewards. For UK users, this is a simple way to explore new tokens while learning about blockchain technology.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Deposits and Withdrawals in the UK
        </h3>

        <p>
          One of the biggest advantages of using <strong>Coinbase UK</strong> is the availability of multiple GBP payment methods. British customers can fund their accounts or withdraw profits via the following options:
        </p>

          <app-tldr [items]="[
          'Faster Payments – standard GBP bank transfers, usually credited the same day.',
          'SEPA transfers – for users with euro accounts.',

        <h3>
          Coinbase Fees UK – How Much Does It Cost?
        </h3>

        <p>
          Costs are one of the most discussed aspects in any Coinbase review UK. While Coinbase is known for safety and ease of use, its fees are relatively higher compared with some <strong>Coinbase alternatives</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the basic <strong>Coinbase exchange UK</strong>, users pay a combination of:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Spread</strong> (0.5% approx. on buy/sell).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flat fee</strong>(e.g., £0.99–£2.99 depending on transaction size).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Percentage fee</strong>(up to 3.99% for card purchases).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          On <strong>Coinbase Pro</strong>, fees are lower and based on the maker/taker model:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Maker fee:
            </strong>starts at 0.4% and decreases with higher volume.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>
              Taker fee:
            </strong>starts at 0.6% and also decreases as volume grows.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This structure means that occasional retail investors may pay more on the basic app, while active traders benefit from Pro.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Comparison with Other UK Crypto Exchanges
        </h3>

        <p>
          When evaluating <strong>Coinbase UK</strong>, it is useful to compare it with other major crypto exchanges in the UK, such as Binance, Kraken, and Bitstamp. Each platform offers a different balance of fees, regulation, available assets, and overall usability.
