          <h2>Step-by-Step Kraken Walkthrough</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Before you start:</strong> Have a UK bank account in your name, a valid ID, and an authenticator app for 2FA. First-time users should complete setup and verification via our <a href="/guides/kraken-setup" style="color: #6366f1; text-decoration: underline;">Kraken Setup Guide</a>; verified users can proceed below.
          </p>

          <h3 id="buying-eth-with-bank-account-faster-payments">Buying ETH with Bank Account (Faster Payments)</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Best for:</strong> most UK buyers building a position over time with low fees.
          </p>

          <h4>1) Open the GBP deposit screen</h4>
          <p>
            In your account go <strong>Funding → Deposit → GBP</strong> and choose Faster Payments. Copy the beneficiary details and the exact reference shown.
          </p>

          <div class="screenshot-placeholder">
            Screenshot: Kraken "Deposit GBP — Faster Payments" screen with reference highlighted
          </div>

          <h4>2) Send the transfer</h4>
          <p>
            From your bank, send the amount via Faster Payments using that reference. Funds typically land within minutes, 24/7.
          </p>

          <div class="screenshot-placeholder">

          </div>

          <h4>3) Buy ETH</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Quick route:</strong> <em>Buy/Sell → Ethereum (ETH) → enter the amount in GBP → preview → Confirm.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Price-controlled route:</strong> open ETH/GBP on Pro, select Limit, set your price, and place the order.
          </p>

          </div>

          <h4>4) Check your balance</h4>
          <p>
            Your ETH appears on the balances page immediately after execution.
          </p>

          <div class="screenshot-placeholder">

          <app-pro-tip text="if you'll repeat purchases monthly, set a standing order from your bank and use limit orders on ETH/GBP for tighter execution."></app-pro-tip>

          <h3 id="buying-eth-with-chaps">Buying ETH with CHAPS (high-volume buyers)</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Best for:</strong> large, time-sensitive deposits where same-day credit matters.
          </p>

          <h4>1) Get CHAPS instructions</h4>
          <p>
            Go <strong>Funding → Deposit → GBP → CHAPS</strong>. Note the beneficiary, account number and your unique reference.
          </p>

          <div class="screenshot-placeholder">
            Screenshot: Kraken "Deposit GBP — CHAPS" instructions screen
          </div>

          <h4>2) Send before your bank's cut-off</h4>
          <p>
            CHAPS is credited the same business day if sent before cut-off. Your bank may charge a flat fee; this is negligible on large transfers.
          </p>

          <h4>3) Place your ETH order</h4>
          <p>
            For sizeable buys, consider a Limit order on ETH/GBP to manage slippage, or split the order into tranches.
          </p>

          <h3 id="buying-eth-with-creditdebit-card">Buying ETH with Credit/Debit Card</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Best for:</strong> instant, small purchases when speed > cost.
          </p>

          <h4>1) Choose card checkout</h4>
          <p>
            Go <strong>Buy Crypto → Ethereum (ETH) → Pay by Card</strong>. Card must be in your name and 3-D Secure enabled.
          </p>

          <div class="screenshot-placeholder">
            Screenshot: Card payment flow with ETH selected and GBP amount field
          </div>

          <h4>2) Confirm the order</h4>
          <p>
            Review the total including processing/spread, then confirm. ETH is credited instantly. For regular or larger buys, switch to Faster Payments to reduce costs.
          </p>

          <h3 id="secure-storage">Secure Storage & Withdrawals</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Short-term on exchange (convenience):</strong> keep ETH in your account if you plan to trade or stake soon. Enable 2FA and a withdrawal whitelist; see our <a href="/guides/security-tips" style="color: #6366f1; text-decoration: underline;">Security Tips</a>.

          </div>

          <p>
            <strong>Long-term self-custody (best practice):</strong> withdraw to a hardware wallet (Ledger or Trezor).
          </p>

          <h4>Withdrawal checklist (do this exactly):</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Open your wallet app and copy your ETH receive address.</li>
            <li>In the exchange, go <strong>Funding → Withdraw → ETH</strong>, Add address, and label it clearly.</li>
            <li>Send a test (e.g., 0.01 ETH).</li>
            <li>Confirm on Etherscan that the test arrived at the correct address.</li>
            <li>Withdraw the remaining amount.</li>
          </ol>

            Staking ETH lets you earn rewards (typically <strong>3–5% APR</strong>) while supporting the Ethereum network. Kraken offers a simple, custodial staking option:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Go to <strong>Earn → Staking</strong> in your account.</li>
            <li>Select <strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong> and review the current APR.</li>
            <li>Confirm the amount to stake — rewards start automatically.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            For advanced users, <strong>liquid staking</strong> tokens like stETH (Lido), cbETH (Coinbase), or rETH (Rocket Pool) allow using staked ETH in DeFi. Be aware of <strong>peg risks</strong> during high volatility.

          <h2>Key Risks to Consider</h2>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Slashing risk:</strong> Validators can be penalised, though Kraken handles operations and covers infrastructure failures.</li>
            <li><strong>Unstaking delays:</strong> Withdrawals from staking may take several days depending on network conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Counterparty risk:</strong> Custodial staking relies on Kraken's solvency and security.</li>
            <li><strong>Peg risk:</strong> Liquid staking tokens (stETH, rETH) can temporarily de-peg in stressed markets.</li>

Always send a small <strong>test transaction</strong>, verify it on <strong>Etherscan</strong>, then withdraw the full amount.
